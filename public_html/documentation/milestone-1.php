			<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>
			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>To present myself in a competent and professional manner to prospective clients and employers.</p>
			<h2>Audience</h2>
			<p>The intended audience of this site is for employment reasons, either to give tangible evidence of my work to
			prospective clients or let employers see the quality/content of my code.</p>
			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>To attract potential clients and employers to myself and my work.</p>
			<h1>Persona</h1>
			<img id="jared" src="../assets/images/photo.jpg" alt="Image of Jared Mason"/>
			<h2 id="about">Jared Mason</h2>
			<p>Mr. Mason is a 32 year old husband, father, and entrepreneur who has started his own photography business. He
			loves his Nikon D850 and has everything he needs to create the best pictures and quality. He uses Adobe Photoshop&reg;
			and several notable plugins to design and edit the professional quality pictures he takes.</p>
			<p>Jared doesn't really want to waste a lot of time trying to solve technical problems, he wants specific and to
			the point when it comes to the answer. He is focused, organized, and knows what he is looking for. When the issue
			is something that he can't complete himself, he wants someone that knows what they are doing.</p>
			<p>He has a website, but doesn't think it is relevant to the clients he wants to reach. He wants something that is up-to-date
			and gives him the image of being "mainstream". He is looking for something that matches his personality, style,
			and no-nonsense attitude. He is looking for a web-developer who has the same mindset as him and advertises
			themselves as knowledgeable. He wants the first impression of the site to meet those requirements as well as displays
			an artistic feel.</p>
