## Milestone 1 Feedback
Beautiful work here - you've done a nice job outlining a purpose/audience/goal and Persona for your project. There's enough detail here to begin a design strategy.

A general approach to a professional portfolio when you're starting out is a great idea - and it fits perfectly within PWP scope. Heads up though - if you do feel that you're leaning more towards seeking out freelance work, your content choices should be focused on appealing to potential clients. There's quite a bit of difference between marketing your skills for clients vs. other developers or tech hiring leads.

Your persona is a photographer, so I'm wondering if this a niche market you'd like to work with. Photogs tend to have _very_ specific wants and needs when it comes to their web presence (depending on the kind of photography they do), and they tend to be quite tech savvy as well. Design and good front end is critically important to technical creatives as well, so an attractive UI would be a big part of attracting these kinds of clients. I definitely think you can create a PWP that bridges the gap between appealing to potential employers and potential clients: Think of ways that you can illustrate your tech skills that is both informative (for potential employers) while being visually engaging and "friendly" enough for potential clients.

Nice CSS too!

Your project has been set up correctly and your code looks great. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
